Applications, scripts, and documentation to perform various performance analysis. 

GPU performance analysis will be in the GPU folder for now.

All scripts in the PERFORMANCE folder are based on Intel OneAPI. 
OneAPI installation:  

   $> dnf config-manager --add-repo https://yum.repos.intel.com/oneapi
   $> rpm --import https://yum.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
   $> dnf install intel-oneapi-mpi-devel

Using the scripts in this directory requires sharing the Intel OneAPI folder 
with compute nodes. Instructions for this can be found in interconnect_perf_validation.pdf

Note that the 2022 switch to CentOS Stream affects some instructions for driver installation.
For example, IFS for Omni-path driver installation works for CentOS8.3 but is not compatible with CentOS Stream. 
The current recommendation is to use CentOS7 - preferrably v7.9
