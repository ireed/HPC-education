Applications, scripts, and documentation to perform various performance analysis - 
including interconnect, NUMA, and parallel programming. 

GPU performance analysis will be in the GPU folder for now.

All scripts in the PERFORMANCE folder are based on Intel OneAPI. 
OneAPI installation:  

   $> dnf config-manager --add-repo https://yum.repos.intel.com/oneapi
   $> rpm --import https://yum.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
   $> dnf install intel-oneapi-mpi-devel

Using the scripts in this directory requires sharing the Intel OneAPI folder 
with compute nodes. Instructions for this can be found in the top-level setup script
