# Single Node 
################


   Simple job launch on one node:
      $> srun hostname
      $> srun <program>
      $> srun -n 1 -w <node> <program>


################
# Multiple Nodes 
################

If executing on multiple nodes, a batch script is recommended. See the 
sample batch script sample_run_script for more information. 

   To submit a job, execute the sample script:
      $> sbatch sample_run_script

   To check the status of your job (note the job ID in the output):
      $> squeue

   Upon completion, the outpt will be in the local file ./slurm-<jobID>.out

It is recommended to use the hydra process manager, as this works for multiple 
versions of MPI, and SHMEM. Additionally, one could use mpirun or oshrun 
for MPI and SHMEM respectively.


Alternatively, jobs on specific nodes can be performed through the command 
line with a comma-separate list of nodes:
      $> srun -n 1 -w node2,node4 hostname
